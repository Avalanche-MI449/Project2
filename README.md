# Project2
Working in your group, create a single page React application that utilizes 3 different data sources. These sources could be public APIs, APIs you create yourself, or browser storage methods like localStorage (JSON files stored on the users browser). The topic of the dashboard can be anything your team would like, as long as it's a single page application and meets the requirements below:

Requirements

1. The application should use React as the main front-end framework.

2. The application should have a clear theme/purpose, a logo, and an overall brand/theme that's used across the site (please avoid the AI-created UI dark mode with gradient font colors).

3. The application should utilize 3 different data sources, you DO NOT have to choose one from each (e.g. you can use 3 APIs, 1 API and two localStorage objects, etc):
    1. Public APIs
    2. Your own homemade APIs (host static JSON files you create on Github Pages)
    3. WebStorage API (localStorage and sessionStorage)

4. The application should have some form of interaction that changes/updates/remixes the data (geolocation, user entry, sorting/searching, etc).

5. The application should be hosted on Netlify using a custom subdomain.

6. Add a link and screenshot of your React dashboard to your team website (make sure this is updated too).

7. Submit links to:
    1. The GitHub repo for the project.
    2. The public Netlify link of the live React dashboard.
    3. The public link to your updated team website.
